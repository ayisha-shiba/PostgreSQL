# DBMS vs RDBMS

**DBMS**

- No relationships between tables.
- Lacks data integrity checks.
- Examples: MS Access, dBase.

**RDBMS**
- Stores data in multiple related tables.
- Uses primary and foreign keys.
- Follows ACID principles.

**Summary:**  
DBMS stores isolated data.  
RDBMS connects and manages data relationally.
