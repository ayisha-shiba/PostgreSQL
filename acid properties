ACID Properties

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the key properties that ensure reliable transaction processing in a database.

Atomicity:

Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit — either all operations are completed or none.

Example: If you transfer ₹500 from Account A to Account B, both debit and credit operations must occur. If one fails, both are rolled back.

Consistency:

Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining all defined rules and constraints.

Example: If total money before and after the transfer remains the same, consistency is maintained.

Isolation:

Ensures that concurrent transactions do not affect each other’s execution.

Example: Two users updating different bank accounts simultaneously should not interfere with each other’s transactions.

Durability:

Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanently saved in the database even after a crash.

Example: After a successful fund transfer, the updated balance remains stored even if the system shuts down
